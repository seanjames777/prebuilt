To use with CMake:

	Simply copy prebuilt/ directory to your top-level, and
	add include(prebuilt/CMakeLists.txt) to your CMakeLists.txt

To use without CMake, simply include the include directory for
your platform, and target the static/shared libraries as usual.

Refer to Updating_Libraries.txt for instructions to build each
library on each platform if they are updated.
